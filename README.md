for the rough sketch:
my design choice is that I want to create a cart that is easy to modify and easy to follow, especially i don't want my cart to be ordinary lists of things since that do not feel like a good shopping experience in a online food store. I want to feature the food product (take more spaces) so people are more willing to buy them.  

for the high-fi prototype: 
My design choice is that since I want to keep the style of my web pages the same throughout, the cart had the same header and footer as other web pages and the same color scheme. Other than that, I kept the cart list rather simple.
